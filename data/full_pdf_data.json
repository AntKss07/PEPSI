Although not dangerously high, levels above 70–80 ng/mL \ncan increase the risk of:\n\u0000 Calcium buildup in the blood and kidneys\nHigh vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia, which may cause kidney stones, vascular calcification, and increased \nurinary calcium.\n\u0000 Kidney strain\nExcess vitamin D increases calcium absorption, which the kidneys must filter, potentially stressing renal function over \ntime.\n\u0000 No added benefit at high levels\nStudies show that vitamin D above 50–60 ng/mL does not provide extra immune or metabolic advantages. Higher \nlevels only increase risk, not benefit.\n\u0000 Safer and more stable metabolism\nKeeping vitamin D in the optimal range (40–60 ng/mL) supports bone, immune, and metabolic health without \nincreasing calcium-related risks.\nI recommend an omega-3 supplement that provides 1 gram of combined EPA and DHA per day, and not more than 2 \ngrams total.\nNordic Naturals Ultimate Omega Soft Gels\nSports Research Omega-3 Fish Oil (Triple Strength)\nThorne Research Omega-3 (Con CoQ10)\n",
