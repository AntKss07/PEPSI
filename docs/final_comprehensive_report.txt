Section 1: My Purpose
Why do I want to improve my health?
Me and my wife like to do hiking and enjoy outdoors and also I want to be healthy to be with my grandkids and kids.
"We all have a reason that motivates us to take care of ourselves.
Come back to this section whenever you need to reconnect with your path."
MY PRIMARY HEALTH GOALS
Based on your goals, lifestyle, and health assessment,
we will prioritize three objectives to bring you closer to your purpose.
Health Goals
Why is this important?
1
Improve liver health by reducing inflammation and 
normalizing liver enzymes.
to protect the liver, improves metabolism, reduces 
cardiovascular risk, and restores whole-body health.
2
Improve Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Flexibility
to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes
3
Improve lipid balance and reduce long-term 
cardiovascular risk.
to prevent progression of atherosclerosis.

Section 2: Results and Findings
HEALTH AND WELLNESS INTEGRAL EVALUATION
OVERALL INTEGRATED CLINICAL SUMMARY
Richard shows:
Normal findings in:
CBC
Renal function
Thyroid
PSA
Electrolytes
Glucose metabolism
Urinalysis & stool exam
Lp(a) (excellent)
Inflammatory markers only mildly elevated
-Abnormal findings centered around:
NAFLD grade II → Elevated AST/ALT, ferritin, low HDL, elevated LDL, mild insulin resistance
Vitamin D excess → 81.8 ng/mL
ApoB slightly elevated
hs-CRP mildly elevated
-Cardiovascular risk remains LOW because:
CAC score = 15
Lp(a) extremely low
ApoB moderate
HDL low due to fatty liver, not arterial disease
High muscularity and high physical activity
Functional Medicine Focus — Priority Areas
Reverse NAFLD (primary goal)
Improve liver detox phases, mitochondrial fat oxidation, hepatic glucose handling.
Improve hepatic insulin sensitivity
Adjust macronutrient timing; increase fiber and plants; adjust fructose load.
Lower inflammation
Through nutrition, circadian alignment, and omega-3.
Support mitochondrial function
Maintain exercise, optimize micronutrients (magnesium, B-complex).
Normalize Vitamin D
Reduce dose.
Improve evening metabolic activity
Introduce low-intensity movement after 3–4 pm.
Dermatologic follow-up
Actinic keratosis & ulcerated lesion require evaluation.

INBODY
94/100
The InBody analysis describes a 65-
year-old man, 188 cm tall and weighing 
109.9 kg, with an exceptionally strong 
and well-preserved body composition 
for his age. His skeletal muscle mass is 
49.7 kg, which is well above average 
and places him in a category of 
excellent muscularity. His fat-free mass 
(87.3 kg) and total body water (64.1 L) 
are also high, reflecting strong muscle 
tissue quality. The whole-body 
ECW/TBW ratio of 0.381 is normal, 
indicating healthy fluid balance, and 
the total phase angle of 6.5° is very 
favorable for his age, showing good 
cell integrity and metabolic function. 
His BMI is 31.1, which is technically in 
the obesity range by definition, but this 
classification does not apply well to 
muscular individuals. The body fat 
percentage of 20.6% is normal for a fit 
adult male and especially good for a 65
-year-old, aligning with his high InBody 
score of 94 out of 100, which confirms 
excellent overall condition. The visceral 
fat area is 106.4 cm², which sits near 
the upper end of normal but not in a 
dangerous or extreme range—
especially for a tall, muscular man. 
Many athletic or well-trained older 
adults fall within this band. His waist 
circumference (102.8 cm) and waist–
hip ratio (0.91) are slightly elevated, 
but these values must be interpreted in 
the context of his large frame and 
muscle mass. Segmental analysis 
shows strong, symmetrical muscle 
across arms, legs, and trunk, with no 
abnormalities. The metabolic rate 
(2255 kcal) is high because of his 
excellent muscle mass. Overall, the 
report paints the picture of a very fit, 
muscular, and healthy older adult with 
excellent cellular integrity, strong 
muscle mass, and only mild age-
related central fat accumulation, which 
is extremely common. Nothing 
indicates a pathological fat level, and 
the high InBody score validates his 
great physical condition.

ECG Interpretation (Normal Study)
  Rhythm & Rate
Normal sinus rhythm, with upright P waves in leads I, II, and aVF.
Rate appears within normal limits (~60–70 bpm).
Consistent P before every QRS and constant PR interval → normal AV conduction.
  Intervals
PR interval: normal.
QRS duration: narrow → no bundle branch block.
QT interval: appears normal for heart rate.
  Axis
Normal frontal plane axis; no deviation.
  QRS Complex
No pathological Q waves.
No signs of ventricular hypertrophy.
Good R-wave progression across precordial leads (V1–V6).
  ST Segment & T Waves
ST segments are isoelectric, without elevation or depression → no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
T waves are normal in morphology and distribution; no inversion or strain pattern.
  Other Findings
No ectopy (no PACs, PVCs).
No signs of pericarditis, electrolyte imbalance, or arrhythmogenic patterns.
Overall Impression
Normal ECG.
No evidence of prior myocardial infarction, ischemia, arrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, or structural heart disease.
Images:

========================================

--- Page 9 - Full Text ---
Non applicable 
Abdominal ultrasound:
The abdominal ultrasound shows moderate hepatic steatosis (grade II) with a mildly enlarged and heterogeneous 
liver, but no focal lesions, no signs of chronic liver disease, and no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis.
The gallbladder is absent due to prior surgery, and the biliary ducts are normal.
The pancreas shows moderate fatty infiltration (lipomatosis), a common age-related finding, with no masses or 
inflammatory changes.
The spleen and kidneys are normal, except for a small simple renal cyst (10 mm) on the right kidney, which is benign 
and requires no intervention.
The aorta, retroperitoneum, and urinary bladder are normal.
The prostate is small and within normal size for his age (17.5 cc).
No free fluid, masses, or bowel abnormalities are seen.
Impression
Moderate hepatic steatosis (grade II).
Moderate pancreatic lipomatosis.
Benign simple renal cyst (right kidney).
Otherwise normal abdominal ultrasound.
Coronary Calcium Score Summary
The patient’s total coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is 15, which places him in the 31st percentile according to 
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) reference values for individuals of the same age, sex, and ethnicity.
Risk Interpretation
A CAC score of 15 corresponds to a low atherosclerotic burden and indicates a low risk of coronary artery disease. 
Most men his age have higher calcium levels, making this an overall favorable finding.
Distribution of Calcium
Left Main (LM): 0
Left Anterior Descending (LAD): 7
Left Circumflex (LCx): 8
Right Coronary Artery (RCA): 0
Posterior Descending Artery (PDA): 0
Other branches: 0
Calcium is limited to small, isolated areas in the LAD and LCx, with no calcification in the Left Main or RCA—an 
excellent prognostic sign.
Clinical Implications
This score reflects low coronary plaque burden and reduced probability of obstructive coronary artery disease.
Supports classification as low cardiovascular risk, especially when combined with his high fitness level and current 
preventive medications (e.g., statin).
Ongoing risk factor management (blood pressure, lipid control, liver health, and lifestyle) remains appropriate.
Follow-Up
According to current ACC/AHA guidelines, repeat CAC scoring is generally considered in 3–5 years, unless new 
symptoms or risk factors emerge.

Section 3: Health Goals
Based on your personal goals, lifestyle, and health assessment,
we will set three key objectives that will allow us to
make significant progress toward your purpose.
Goal #1:
Reverse Fatty Liver (NAFLD Grade II)
KEY RESULTS
KEY ACTIONS
FREQUENCY
Improve liver health by reducing 
inflammation and normalizing liver 
enzymes.
Implement a liver-focused, anti-
inflammatory diet:
Reduce fructose (replace banana 
with ½ banana or berries).
Increase vegetable intake to 6–7 
servings/day.
Avoid refined sugars and processed 
foods.
daily 
Add afternoon metabolic movement:
10–15 minutes of light walking after 
lunch and dinner.
Avoid prolonged sitting after 3 pm; 
move 3–5 minutes each hour.
6 days a week 
Support liver detoxification pathways 
with adequate hydration and 
phytonutrients:
Drink 1.5–2.0 liters of water daily, 
especially in the morning to reduce 
hepatic congestion.
Include daily liver-supportive foods 
such as cruciferous vegetables 
(broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels 
sprouts), leafy greens, garlic, onions, 
and fresh herbs (cilantro, parsley).
These enhance phase I and phase II 
detoxification, reduce oxidative 
stress, and support hepatic fat 
clearance.

Goal #2:
Improve Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Flexibility
KEY RESULTS
KEY ACTIONS
FREQUENCY
Reduce hepatic insulin resistance 
and improve metabolic efficiency.
Adjust fasting and feeding schedule:
Maintain morning fasting but add a 
small protein-based afternoon snack 
(Greek yogurt or nuts) to prevent 
hepatic overload.
Ensure each meal contains protein + 
fiber.
daily 
Increase daily fiber intake:
1–2 teaspoons of psyllium or ground 
flaxseed daily.
Supports glucose control and liver 
detoxification.

Complements his strength training 
routine.
cardio 3 times a week 
Goal #3:
Optimize Cardiovascular Risk and Improve Lipid Profile
KEY RESULTS
KEY ACTIONS
FREQUENCY
Improve lipid balance and reduce 
long-term cardiovascular risk.
Improve fat quality and increase 
natural omega-3 intake:
Eat fatty fish 2–3 times per week 
(salmon, sardines, tuna).
Limit red meat to 1–2 times per 
week.
as indicated 
Reduce Vitamin D supplementation:
Lower dose to 2,000–3,000 IU/day.
Goal serum level: 50–70 ng/mL.

Section 6: Follow-up and Frequency
Recording your goals allows you to measure your effort,
recognize your progress, and adjust your targets when necessary.
We recommend tracking this habit using any of the following methods:
Smart watch to track steps
Interaction With Supplements
Safe with rivaroxaban:
Omega-3 (≤2 g/day) → mild increase in bleeding risk but still considered safe
Vitamin D (decreasing dose is advised anyway)
Psyllium, flaxseed
Magnesium
B-complex
Use with caution:
Turmeric/curcumin in high doses
Ginger supplements
High-dose fish oil (>2 g/day EPA/DHA)
Vitamin E > 400 IU/day
Avoid:
Ginkgo biloba
High-dose garlic supplements
These can increase bleeding risk.
vitamin D level (81.8 ng/mL) is above the optimal range. Although not dangerously high, levels above 70–80 ng/mL 
can increase the risk of:
  Calcium buildup in the blood and kidneys
High vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia, which may cause kidney stones, vascular calcification, and increased 
urinary calcium.
  Kidney strain
Excess vitamin D increases calcium absorption, which the kidneys must filter, potentially stressing renal function over 
time.
  No added benefit at high levels
Studies show that vitamin D above 50–60 ng/mL does not provide extra immune or metabolic advantages. Higher 
levels only increase risk, not benefit.
  Safer and more stable metabolism
Keeping vitamin D in the optimal range (40–60 ng/mL) supports bone, immune, and metabolic health without 
increasing calcium-related risks.
I recommend an omega-3 supplement that provides 1 gram of combined EPA and DHA per day, and not more than 2 
grams total.
