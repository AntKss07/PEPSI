  "inbody_interpretation": "a 65- year-old man, 188 cm tall and weighing  109.9 kg, with an exceptionally strong  and well-preserved body composition  for his age. His skeletal muscle mass is  49.7 kg, which is well above average  and places him in a category of  excellent muscularity. His fat-free mass  (87.3 kg) and total body water (64.1 L)  are also high, reflecting strong muscle  tissue quality. The whole-body  ECW/TBW ratio of 0.381 is normal,  indicating healthy fluid balance, and  the total phase angle of 6.5° is very  favorable for his age, showing good  cell integrity and metabolic function.  His BMI is 31.1, which is technically in  the obesity range by definition, but this  classification does not apply well to  muscular individuals. The body fat  percentage of 20.6% is normal for a fit  adult male and especially good for a 65 -year-old, aligning with his high InBody  score of 94 out of 100, which confirms  excellent overall condition. The visceral  fat area is 106.4 cm², which sits near  the upper end of normal but not in a  dangerous or extreme range— especially for a tall, muscular man.  Many athletic or well-trained older  adults fall within this band. His waist  circumference (102.8 cm) and waist– hip ratio (0.91) are slightly elevated,  but these values must be interpreted in  the context of his large frame and  muscle mass. Segmental analysis  shows strong, symmetrical muscle  across arms, legs, and trunk, with no  abnormalities. The metabolic rate  (2255 kcal) is high because of his  excellent muscle mass. Overall, the  report paints the picture of a very fit,  muscular, and healthy older adult with  excellent cellular integrity, strong  muscle mass, and only mild age- related central fat accumulation, which  is extremely common. Nothing  indicates a pathological fat level, and  the high InBody score validates his  great physical condition.",
